“Watch4Coins” is a cool App built especially for your crypto wealthiness. You can earn coins for free by just watching Ads in your mobile phone. Watching = Mining!
The mining procedure is extremely simple. Press the button to show up one Ads. After the Ads is played and watched. Then, you will get 10 credit points. If you accumulate sufficient credit points, then you can exchange these credit points for coin(s), which are called AD Coin (ADC). This exchange procedure is done automatically and ensured by the technologies of smart contract and blockchain of Polygon. After several confirmation steps of transactions, then the coin(s) will be sent to your wallet for free.
All the issued 10 billion of coins go to miners. The mining difficulty will be increased by each year. Hence, it is highly suggested to mine it as early as possible. We will soon create the pools of ADC and Matic coins of Polygon blockchain in UniSwap so that you can swap ADC to Matic coins which are freely and widely circulated in crypto markets. Please support this project so that more features could be offered in near future.
